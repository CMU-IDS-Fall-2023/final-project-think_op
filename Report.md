Short (~250 words) abstract of the concrete data science problem and how the solutions addresses the problem.

This project seeks to decipher the complex relationship between terrorism and refugee movements, utilizing comprehensive data from the Global Terrorism Database and UN Refugee Data. The former encompasses over 200,000 records from 1970 to 2021, cataloging terrorist incidents with detailed attributes including location, casualties, and motives. Conversely, the UN Refugee Data chronicles annual refugee figures, specifying their countries of origin and destinations for asylum.

The principal aim is to analyze the progression of terrorist activities over time and across regions and to investigate any potential correlation between the incidence of terrorism and the patterns of refugee migration. We hypothesize a direct link between regional terrorism rates and the resultant movements of refugees. Integrating these datasets allows us to conduct a thorough exploration and time-series analysis, aligning the information based on country and date.

Our deliverable includes a suite of interactive visualizations, designed to engage users and offer profound insights into the dynamics of global terrorism and refugee trends.

The dashboard comprises four interactive pages. Each page enables users to delve into the relationship between the two datasets through various interactive plots. One dedicated page for each dataset provides an overview of recent trends and general patterns in terrorist attacks and refugee flows, acquainting users with the broader context of these complex issues. The other two pages offer a deeper examination of the interconnection between these datasets.
