## Deliverables

### Proposal

- [ ] The URL at the top of this readme needs to point to your application online. It should also list the names of the team members.
- [ ] A completed [proposal](Proposal.md). Each student should submit the URL that points to this file in their github repo on Canvas.

### Sketches

- [ ] Develop sketches/prototype of your project.

For the global terrorism dataset, we would have an interactive map that could be adjusted to display whichever time window, countries, and other attributes of attacks the user selected. We would also have a pie chart displaying the composition of attributes the user chose and a line graph incorporating a forecasting model to display the number of past attacks and predictions for future attack counts.

For the global refugee dataset, we would include a Sankey Diagram to better illustrate the flow of refugees. As for the correlation between the terrorism data and refugee data, we would include a heatmap for the refugee count and terrorist attack count to examine their relationships, as well as a simple bar chart with two bars per country that represent the two quantities.

### Final deliverables

- [ ] All code for the project should be in the repo.
- [ ] Update the **Online URL** above to point to your deployed project.
- [ ] A detailed [project report](Report.md).  Each student should submit the URL that points to this file in their github repo on Canvas.
- [ ] A 5 minute video demonstration.  Upload the video to this github repo and link to it from your report.
